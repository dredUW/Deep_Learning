# Deep_Learning_HW
In this assignment we worked with deep learning recurrent neural networks. We created two models to predict bitcoin prices. The first model utilized the Crypto Fear and Greed Index the second model used closing prices.
There were 3 key questions we wanted to answer.
1. Which model has a lower loss?
2. Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
3. Which window size works best for the model?
/n
The analysis answered the questions in the following:
1. Which model has a lower loss?
* 1a. The closing price model had the lower lower los
2. Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
* 2a. The closing price model tracks the actual values better over time
3. Which window size works best for the model?
* 3a The window size of 10 seems to work well. Larger and smaller window sizes didn't tended to result in larger losses.
